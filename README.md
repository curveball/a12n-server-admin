# Project 21: a12n-server
## Partner Intro
 Evert Pot, evert@sproutfamily.com

a12n-server is a lightweight authentication server. The goal of a12n-server is to provide a simple authentication system for developers. It uses databases for access tokens, clients and users.
 

## Description about the project
a12-server, a personal project initiated by our partner in 2018, emerged as a solution to the limited availability of lightweight open-source OAuth2 servers for Node.js. While alternatives like Auth0, Supertokens, and Keycloak offered robust features, they were either cumbersome or lacked TypeScript support. a12n-server presented a refreshing alternative, boasting faster startup times and a leaner footprint compared to its competitors.

## Key Features
 * Browsable API endpoints with:
    * errors and responses displayed in HTML and JSON
    * HAL-formatted user resources.
  * Seamless communication with databases like Postgres and MySQL.
  * Admin UI with user permission and app management
  * A flat permission model
  * OAuth2 implementation
  * MFA
    * Google Authenticator (TOTP).
  * WebauthN / Yubikeys
  * Registration flow with one-time passcode (OTP)
  * Forgot-my-password flow

## Instructions
  End-users, who are admins in our case, can access the server through a standalone user interface.  Get a test server by running:

  ```sh
  mkdir a12n-server && cd a12n-server
  npx @curveball/a12n-server
  ```
  This will automatically create a configuration file and sqlite database in the current directory.

  Then, just open http://localhost:8531/ to create your admin account
 
 ## Development requirements
 * Node.js 18.x
 * MySQL, Postgress or Sqlite
