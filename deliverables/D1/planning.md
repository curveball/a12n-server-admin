## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

High-Level Description:
The product is a lightweight, open-source authentication solution designed to simplify and streamline user authentication for developers and organizations.

Problem Statement:
Existing authentication solutions, such as Auth0, Supertokens, and Keycloak, can be complex, heavyweight, or require significant time and resources to integrate. Developers and organizations need a faster, more efficient, and more accessible way to implement authentication while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

What Weâ€™re Building:

- A standalone Admin UI for managing user authentication.
- An API abstraction layer that integrates with popular databases like Postgres and MySQL, allowing developers to easily add, update, or query user authentication data.
- A modular authentication system that can be integrated into various development stacks with minimal setup.
- Open-source availability, allowing anyone to use, adapt, and contribute to the product, fostering community-driven improvements and ensuring widespread accessibility.
  
Context:
The product aims to compete with popular authentication solutions by offering a lightweight, open-source alternative that reduces overhead for developers and encourages innovation through community involvement.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Independent Developers:

Example: A freelance developer working on a small-scale web application who needs a secure, quick-to-implement authentication solution without incurring licensing costs.

Startup Teams:

Example: A small team building a SaaS product with limited resources and time for implementing a custom authentication solution. Open-source access ensures they can integrate and customize the product to fit their needs without financial barriers.

Tech Enterprises:

Example: A mid-sized company seeking a more modular and lightweight alternative to existing proprietary authentication systems, with the flexibility to modify the code to suit their internal standards.

Open-Source Enthusiasts and Contributors:

Example: Developers passionate about improving community-driven tools who can adapt and enhance the product for their specific use cases while contributing back to the open-source ecosystem.

Educators & Learners:

Example: A third-year computer science student building a secure web application and seeking a lightweight, open-source tool for experimentation and learning.
#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

1) Time Efficient: The first benefit of using our product is time efficiency. Most platforms, like Auth0, are complex. Our solution provides a straightforward setup process that lets developers integrate authentication features quickly. 

2) Cost-Effective: Since our project is open-source there are no licensing fees, making it ideal for independent developers and startups. Moreover, having a global community helps ensure that the product stays up to date. 

3) Customization Friendly: Our product allows users to choose designs that fit their specific tech stack and needs, which offers much more flexibility than rigid alternatives. 

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

## Potential Risks

#### Q13. What are some potential risks to your project?
* Now that you have defined your project, what risks can you identify that might impact it?
* Some examples of risks at this planning stage could include:
  * Uncertainties regarding a specific feature
  * Lack of clarity in execution
  * Insufficient discussion with partners
  * User stories that are too abstract or too simple
* For each risk, provide a brief bullet point and then explain the risk in detail. 

#### Q14. What are some potential mitigation strategies for the risks you identified?
* Examples of mitigation strategies:
  * More communication with the partner might help with improving clarity.
  * Adding more details for an user story might make it less abstract.
  * Adding an extra user story might increase the project complexity, making it less simple.
* It's ok if you are unable to find mitigation strategies for all the risks right now.
