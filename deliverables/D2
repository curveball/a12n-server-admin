Part 3 – Documentation:
The final step is to document the work done. Each team must submit one report containing three important parts:
Project Planning - This section captures all activities completed during the Project Planning phase. It should include:
A summary of the project plan outlining the sequence of user stories and development milestones.
The final system model (e.g., class diagram, sequence diagramLinks to an external site., component diagramLinks to an external site.) that represents the project’s architecture. You can refer to these examplesLinks to an external site. and slides 8 and 30 discussed in class lectures.
The division of work into three sub-teams, explaining the reasoning behind the distribution.
Summary of the technology stack chosen for the project (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, databases, cloud services, etc.) and why. 

Sub-Teams - Each sub-team adds a section that clearly documents the work they completed during the Implementation phase. It should include:
Team members in this sub-team and their roles.
A description of the specific features, modules, or components built by the sub-team.
Lessons learned from this phase.
What worked well?
What didn’t work well? What can you do better for future deliverables? 

Team - This section provides a high-level overview of the team’s collective progress in implementing the project. It should contain:
A detailed explanation of the common foundation built at the start of the Implementation phase.
A summary of how the sub-teams' work contributed to the overall project. 
The team’s overall progress in the context of the roadmap from the Planning phase.
Any major technical or organizational challenges encountered and how they were handled.
You need to add this report to the `deliverables/D2/` folder of your project repo (similar to how you did in D1).
