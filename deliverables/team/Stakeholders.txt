I. Partners

Sprout Family:
The scope of the project is to revamp the UI for the Admin page of the authentification server Sprout Family uses, more specifically, the a12n server (https://github.com/curveball/a12n-server). 
We aim to create a standalone interface that interacts with the server when going through an initial sign-in and OAuth2 flow to be autheniticated. Once authenticated, the new a12n-admin UI will be displayed.
